Hello friends, family and strangers. I created this site for two reasons: 
* To limit the amount of data being collected on me by big tech without sacrificing my ability to stay in touch with people 
* To provide a platform to properly articulate my thoughts that is not possible on traditional social media platforms. 

So i'm kicking it old school and made a personal website. So 90's!!

Stay tuned I will be posting some articles covering business, tech, martial arts and life.
